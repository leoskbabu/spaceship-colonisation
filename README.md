# spaceship-colonisation

This is a REST API which helps the spaceship colonisation. It does not have a front end code, just the backe end functionality.

#Getting started
clone this project to your IDE

#Prerequisites
NodeJS installed
any web broswer
Postman - to test the functionality

#Project Setup
Import project to you workspace
open the terminal and type npm start
open "http://localhost:3000/".
Now you can see the open message on the webpage.

#Testing
Now we are going to test the functions by adding, deleting and updating

Use postman to set the url and
 
use GET for retreiving the data
use POST to add the spaceships and locations(for spaceships- localhost:3000/spaceships and for locations- localhost:3000/locations)
use PUT to update the details by passing Id for both spaceships and location in url
use DELETE to delete the spaceship or location by passing id

For travelling functionlaity we need to pass two id (localhost:3000/location/id/locid){ie spaceship id and location id}

Thank you
